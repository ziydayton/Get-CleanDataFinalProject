Data Set Information: (From: http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones )
Data Set Source: (https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip)

The experiments have been carried out with a group of 30 volunteers within an age bracket of 19-48 years. Each person performed six activities (WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING) wearing a smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S II) on the waist. Using its embedded accelerometer and gyroscope, we captured 3-axial linear acceleration and 3-axial angular velocity at a constant rate of 50Hz. The experiments have been video-recorded to label the data manually. The obtained dataset has been randomly partitioned into two sets, where 70% of the volunteers was selected for generating the training data and 30% the test data. 

The script "run_analysis.R" merges the test and train data sets and then finds the average of the 86 mean and standard deviation (std) variable for a Subject and their respective Activity. This code book summarizes the variables (columns) in the tidy data produced by the run_analysis.R script.  NOTE:  The assertation that the produced data, "AverageMeasures.txt", is tidy because it fulfills the the 4 applicable traits of a tidy data set; (1) Each measured variable is in one column, (2) Each different observation of that variable is in a different row, (3) Each kind of variable can form its own table, and (4) There are column(s) in the table that link to variables. [Criteria derived from the Coursera, Get & Clean Data, course material.]
